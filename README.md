Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

This version of Tic-Tac-Toe is played in a shell and features a simple, easy-to-use interface. Players can enter their names and take turns choosing a box on the grid to place their symbol.
